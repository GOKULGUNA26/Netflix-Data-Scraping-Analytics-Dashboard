# Netflix-Data-Scraping-Analytics-Dashboard
Scraped movie and TV show data from Netflix using Python and BeautifulSoup, then analyzed and cleaned the data using Pandas and Seaborn. Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize genre trends, content ratings, and country-wise distributions.


This project explores how we can turn raw data from Netflix into meaningful insights. It starts by collecting data through web scraping, followed by data cleaning and analysis in Python, and ends with an interactive dashboard built using Tableau.


# What This Project Does

- Scrapes real-time data (title, genre, release year, rating, description, etc.) from the Netflix website.

- Cleans and analyzes the data using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

- Visualizes insights like top genres, content distribution, rating trends, and country-wise data using Tableau.


# Why I Built This

I wanted to understand what kind of content dominates Netflix – which genres are popular, how content is rated, and which countries produce the most content. This project helped me explore the complete data journey — from scraping to storytelling.

# Tools & Technologies

- Python (for web scraping and analysis)

- BeautifulSoup + requests (to scrape Netflix site)

- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis & visualization)

- Tableau Public (for dashboard creation)

# How It Works (Step-by-Step)

- Scraping:

Used Python and BeautifulSoup to extract movie/show details from Netflix’s genre page.

Extracted data includes title, genre, release year, cast, rating, and description.


- Data Cleaning & Analysis:

Used Pandas to clean the dataset and remove empty or duplicate entries.

Analyzed rating distributions, popular genres, and content trends over the years.


- Dashboard Creation:

Created visual charts in Tableau to display country-wise content, top genres, rating breakdowns, and content type ratios (Movie vs. TV Show).
